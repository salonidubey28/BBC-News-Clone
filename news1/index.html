                killing about 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage.

        <p>In response, Israel vowed to "crush and destroy Hamas" so that it no longer posed any threat, and to bring
            all the hostages home.</p>

        <p>In the brutal war that has followed, at least 33,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the
            Hamas-run health ministry, and large parts of Gaza have been destroyed.</p>

        <p>Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas fighters and destroyed much of the vast network of tunnels
            beneath Gaza, which Hamas has used to carry out attacks.</p>

        <p>BBC Verify has combed through public statements and social media posts by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and
            assessed the evidence behind Israel's stated aims.</p>

        <p>Before 7 October, Hamas was thought to have about 30,000 fighters in Gaza, according to reports quoting IDF
            commanders.</p>

        <p>Many of Hamas's senior political figures such as Ismail Haniyeh, widely considered to be the group's overall
            leader, live abroad. But many of its military leadership structure are thought to be inside Gaza.</p>

        <p>In a recent statement, the IDF said it had killed about 13,000 Hamas fighters since the start of the war,
            although it did not say how it calculated that figure.</p>

        <p>Israel also publishes the names of individual Hamas leaders it says have been killed.</p>
        <p>A total of 113 people have been named in this way since October, the overwhelming majority of whom were
            reported killed in the first three months of the war. By comparison, the Israeli army did not report any
            senior Hamas leaders killed in Gaza this year until March.</p>

        <p>On 26 March, the IDF said it had killed Marwan Issa, deputy commander of Hamas's military wing. Considered
            one of Israel's most-wanted men, he would be the group's most senior leader to be killed since the war
            began. The US has said it believes he was killed, but Hamas has not confirmed it.</p>

        <p>The IDF publishes names of individuals who it says are senior Hamas leaders who have been killed, but it is
            not possible to verify whether they are members of the group. One of those named in this category was
            Mustafa Thuraya, who was working as a freelance journalist in <span

                in January.</span></p>

        <p>We also found duplicate names in the list, which we have discounted from the total.</p>

        <p>Outside Gaza,<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> Hamas political leader Saleh
                al-Arouri died in an explosion</span> in Beirut's southern suburb of
            Dahiyeh in January. Israel is widely considered responsible for that attack.</p>
        <p>However, experts we spoke to said many of the group's prominent leaders in Gaza, including Yahya Sinwar, are
            still believed to be alive.</p>

        <p>We asked the IDF how many tunnels, and what proportion of the total tunnel network, they had destroyed. In
            their reply, they said their forces had "destroyed a great deal of the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza"./p>
        <p>The IDF has occasionally shown evidence of Hamas tunnels they've uncovered. For example, in November, the IDF
            released video footage of part of a tunnel network underneath the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City which it

            October 2023 and 26 March 2024.</p>
        <p>Of these, 198 mentioned the discovery of tunnels, where the army said it had located tunnels or tunnel
            shafts. Another 141 messages claim that a tunnel has been destroyed or dismantled.</p>
